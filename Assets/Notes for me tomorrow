Make abilitys generic.

the type is an eventType

Add a trigger method that takes the generic

Each of the subclass abilities will have an event type corresponding with the trigger, this will allow
contextual information to be passed.. who owns the item, location etc


This should allow the existing step logic for staircase traversal to move into its trigger method
and the lucky coin receives a different event which contains the attack result which it can manipulate to survive the attack...
