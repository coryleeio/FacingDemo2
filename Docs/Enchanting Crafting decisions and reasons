Why crafting should be a simple item map and no arbitrary enchanting is allowed.

problem: if you enchant a fireball wand with poison it is called fireball wand, but now applies poison
problem: name would not change when enchanting a wand
problem: zapping requires charges, but theyd be on the enchantment, requiring you to make enchantments that dont apply effects

solution: just use an item map when enchanting items.   just a list of input templates and output templates, no state changes for enchantment, just more items
downside: more item defs
upside: simpler.
problem: wands would be super OP because they let you apply effects at arnge, so you'd need to enumerate possibilities anyway.



Lets just use an item map for doing crafting if I decide to add it.  (map of N items into 1 item) 
it just requires you to enumerate the possibilities, something you'd likely want to do anyway.

We can then add a recharge mecahnic for charges, and just change the poison dagger to be magical instead of being coated in poison
then you get to have limited charges, but not have 

Decision: there will not be any applied poison esque things, because it wouldn't make sense for them to be recharged magically.
Decision: all recharging will be done by a single magical item, you will decide where to invest it
Decision: If I add crafting I will do it as a map of N items to 1
Decision: No poison apply item, just poison apply enchantments.
Decision: Enchanting will just be combining item and enchantment item into another mapped item, and so be part of the aforementioned crafting. IF it is added, which it might not be.
Decision: charges must live on the item, because you have to know about them to zap, you cant push them down to the params
